# html5-sparql-browser

HTML5 facet browser is intended to be used as a search engine for datasets published as Linked Data, available 
through SPARQL endpoints. It provides a flat browsing capability through the dataset by combining search, facets and
operations on sets of resources.

Using HTML5 Web Storage, we enable the option to store the RDF results for future use, locally, in the browser storage.
The facet browser provides a broader view on the stored data and management functionalities over it. The locally stored
RDF triples can be serialized in several RDF formats, downloaded as separated files and then used in applications,
analysis or shared with other users. We believe these features help the users to overcome the existing SPARQL endpoint
availability issues.

The original goal of the project was to simplify the process of searching the Web of Open and Linked Data by using
facets, and to provide more services and options to their users. With our application, we would also like to encourage
development of innovative applications and services over Linked and Open Data.
